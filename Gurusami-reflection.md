##GPS 1.1

**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

I was struggling a bit with the idea of having local branches and pushing them to a remote location, then merging them with a local master branch.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

I liked being able to work with GitHub with a partner. We haven't yet experienced the benefits, and it was good to work with someone else on the same project from different locations. I also had an easier time understanding feature branches and why we use them.

**What questions did you ask your pair and your guide?**

We had a lot of questions between the two of us! I can't remember all of them, but some of them were similar to:
>Do we have to merge our local branches before pushing them to GitHub?
>What exactly does git push origin feature-branch mean?
>How do we insert emojis to a comment?

**What still confuses you about git?**

I'm still confused about merge conflicts. When there's a merge conflict, why can't you just pull from the remote location to whatever branch you're on to overwrite the conflict? When we tried to fix the conflict, we ended up fixing it on the feature branch, but our master branch was still out of date. When we tried to merge it, it wouldn't merge because of the conflict that we thought we fixed. I'm still not really sure how this works.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

It was great! It was really nice to be able to work with another person, and have some of the same problems and successes. It was also very cool to learn little tips and tricks from each other.
